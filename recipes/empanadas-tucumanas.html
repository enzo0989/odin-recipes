        this dish needs a little more work than the others presented in this
        page so the steps guide will consist of three parts: tenderizing the
        meat, making the dough and the preparation itself.
      </p>
      <h4 class="header-sub">How to tenderize the rosemeat</h4>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li class="steps-item">
          Degrease the rosemeat with a sharp knife. it isn't necessary to take
          all of it so don't stress too much if there are some parts hard to
          take out.
        </li>
        <li class="steps-item">
          put the rosemeat on a cooking pot with a vegetable broth. once the
          meat is placed, put some thyme,oregano and rosemary to spice up a bit.
        </li>
        <li class="steps-item">let it cook for 2 hours with minimum heat</li>
        <li class="steps-item">
          once the time has passed take out the meat and keep the broth as is
          needed in the next steps.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4 class="header-sub">How to make the dough</h4>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li class="steps-item">
          Mix 500gr of flour 0000 with 7gr of salt and 75gr of butter in a
          counter or table.
        </li>
        <li class="steps-item">Knead the ingredients with your hands till they mix completely.</li>
        <li class="steps-item">
          Add 190 ml of warm water or the broth you keep and knead until you
          have a smooth and homogeneous bun.
        </li>
        <li class="steps-item">
          cut the bun into two or three parts. Expand them with your hand and
          cut them into circular shapes of around 10 cm.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="steps-p">
        Now that the meat is tender and you made the "tapas" to fill with the
        filling you can start to make the empanadas tucumanas.
      </p>
      <h4 class="header-sub">Preparation</h4>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li class="steps-item">in a frying pan or cooking pot melt the fat.</li>
        <li>
          once the fat is melted put a previously chopped onion with a little
          bit of salt. cook with medium heat for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li >
          Once the time has passed add the tender rosemeat chopped in tiny bits.
          remove from the fire and add the broth with paprika, cumin and ground
          chili. Let it rest for a while.
        </li>
        <li class="steps-item">
          while you let the filling cool, cut the green onion with a boiled egg.
        </li>
        <li class="steps-item">
          Extend the dough in your hand or in a table an fill it with the cold
          filling and a little bit of egg and green onion you previously
          chopped.
        </li>
        <li class="steps-item">
          close the dough. you can do it the way you want or do it the
          traditional way with "repulgue". Repeat the process with all the
          doughs.
        </li>
        <li class="steps-item">
          once you can't do more, put all of them in a preheated oven dish and
          cook them in a preheated oven at 180° for 20 minutes.
        </li>
