    <h1>Pastel de Papa/ Potato Cake</h1>
    <img src="../images/pastel.jpg" alt="the finished potato cake recipe">
    <h2>a really controversial classic</h2>
    <p>this is one of those dishes that almost no one that tastes it dislikes it, i mean, how could you? it's tasty, has a good mix of ingredients, doesn't cost a lot to make and looks really good on a plate. </p>
    <p>you may ask: if it's so good, why do you say that it's controversial? well the thing that happens with the pastel de papa is that there are a lot of ways to make it. I don't mean it in a regional sense, to my knowledge there are not diferent recipes based on the place you were born. The real difference comes on each family because everyone makes the pastel de papa different; some people use dough to make it more firm, others put olives to add a particular taste and others, for some degenerate reason, use raisins.
        this are just a few example of the great variety of posible ingredients that this wonderful dish can have.
    </p>
    <p>In this case we will make a traditional version, but keep in mind, as i mentioned it earlier, that you can expand the recipe with a lot of ingredients.</p>
